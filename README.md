# Here to Record
All sorts of free things to use on your own projects, as shown over on our blog, https://heretorecord.com/blog.

## Live streaming countdown
This is the countdown timer we use during breaks on a live stream. We insert it onto a page on our site that was built specifically for live streaming.
The timer allows the viewers to know how long before the next talk!
See the code right here: https://github.com/iamjohnbarker/heretorecord/tree/master/live-stream-countdown

More coming soon!
